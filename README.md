# Surface Temperature Exploration

## What this repo is
So far this is just some of my experimentation with ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Ultimately the goal is to bring insights and learnings from looking at global environmental indicators historically/over time into a larger GIS project.

What ends up getting populated most here may just be an *examples/* directory, i.e. a survey of interesting operations one could perform with the ArcGIS API based on a few wonderful, publicly available sources (listed below, more to come).
